K-Means Clustering Algorithm

1. select number of clusters in data (let K = 3)

2. Create GroupPoints randomly

3. For each circle in circles:
      Find distance between the point and GroupPoint.
      Assign the CirclePoint's GroupPoint to nearest GroupPoint.
      Save coordinates of CirclePoint to the GroupPoint.

4. Calculate the mean coordinate of each GroupPoint and move the GroupPoint to that mean

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until positions don't change
